# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## "hello, world!"

This is the first application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/). Hello, world!

Some of the technologies I learned to use through this tutorial:
* Sqlite3
* YAML
* Ruby embedded templates in html
* selenium testing

I completed this in December 2018 as a private repo. Re-initialized as a public repo in June 2020 to protect API keys.
